<h2> Personal Goals for My Project</h2>
<p>   
My goal for this project is to create a cool and visually appealing website that focuses on
popular anime and their main characters. I want to push myself to design something that looks
clean, organized, and interesting while also giving good information. I’m hoping this project
helps me improve how I present creative ideas and structure content while showing something I
genuinely enjoy.
</p>

<h2> What I Hope to Make </h2>
<p>
I want to make a website that talks about well-known anime shows and their storylines,
characters, and special abilities. I want it to explain how each anime is different but how they
sometimes share the same kind of messages or themes like teamwork, friendship, and
overcoming challenges. Each section will highlight what makes the anime stand out and why it’s
loved by so many fans.
</p>
     <h2>Why</h2>
<p>
I chose anime because it’s something I really enjoy and connect with. Anime has amazing
stories, great character development, and lessons that a lot of people can relate to. I think it’s
interesting how different shows can tell completely different stories but still share similar life
messages. This project lets me combine my love for anime with my creative side.
Content and How It Relates to the Experience Format
The website will include popular anime like Naruto, Attack on Titan, Dragon Ball Z, My Hero
Academia, and Demon Slayer. It’ll have details about the main plots, the most important
characters, their abilities, and how each show sends its own message. The format will be a mix
of text, pictures, and maybe short clips or animations so that it’s both fun to look at and easy to
read.</p>

<h2> Why.2</h2>
<p>I’m just someone who really loves anime and enjoys breaking down the shows, characters, and moments that stick with me. I like keeping things simple, chill, and easy to follow so anyone can get what I’m saying, even if they don’t watch a ton of anime. I’m always checking out new series, rewatching my favorites, and finding little details that make these stories hit even harder. For me, anime is something I genuinely enjoy talking about, and I like sharing what I notice and why certain characters, scenes, or themes stand out.</p>
